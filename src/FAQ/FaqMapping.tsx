        We are currently still in the planning phase for our wedding and have
        not yet established the details for our ceremony. But due to limited
        space and our desire for an intimate gathering, we plan to only send out
        a few invitations for our wedding. Invitations will be sent via mail,
        then we will personally follow up to ensure they got delivered. Those
        who receive an invitation will be able to RSVP on our website.
        <br />
        <br />
        We hope you understand and we appreciate your support and love for our
        special day.
